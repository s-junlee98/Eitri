## Code and Spec File

### Inspecting the Python Code

The code for Eitri is writtn in python. You can see the code by downloading the file and opening it in a compatible code editor.

### Inspecting the Spec File

The spec file is required when packaging the python file into an executable (.exe) program. It maps any resources required to turn the python file into a standalone executable file.

For example, Eitri contains a number of default .tex templates. The final executable file must contain these templates - the spec file helps the package 'generator' to understand which resources are needed.

### Compiling the Python Code

To compile the python code into an executable program:

1. Install 'pyinstaller' by executing 'pip install pyinstaller'.
2. Open a CMD window, and navigate to the diretory which contains the python file, the 'res' folder, and the spec file.
3. Execute: 'pyinstaller Eitri.spec'
4. This will generate a number of additional folders during the process. Simply wait until the command is fully executed.
5. A new folder called 'dist' should appear. This folder contains the standalone Eitri.exe file.
