# Eitri - Offline Pandoc Document Converter

### Introduction

This is a side project that I've been working on during my time as a tech writer. Here's the context:

- Generally, most companies will employ single-source strategty to avoid duplicating technical content. These source files are generally written in Markdown.
- However, this content may need to be distributed in multiple forms (e.g. HTML, PDF, etc).
- At the same time, they may contain IP (Intellectual Property) or other proprietary/sensitive content which cannot be uploaded onto the cloud.
- Eitri is an **offline** tool which converts markdown and docx files into HTML, LaTeX, or PDF files. It's written in **python**, and utilises **Pandoc**.
