# Eitri
Offline Pandoc Document Converter

This is a side project that I've been working on during my time as a tech writer.

### Introduction

Generally, most companies will employ single-source strategty to avoid duplicating technical content.

However, this content may need to be distributed in multiple forms (e.g. HTML, PDF, etc).

At the same time, they may contain IP (Intellectual Property) or other proprietary/sensitive content which cannot be uploaded onto the cloud.

Eitri is an **offline** tool which converts markdown and docx files into HTML, LaTeX, or PDF files. It's written in **python**, and utilises **Pandoc**.
